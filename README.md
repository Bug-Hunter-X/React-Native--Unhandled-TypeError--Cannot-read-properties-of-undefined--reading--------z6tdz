This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug: accessing state before it's initialized.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that leads to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a robust solution using optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle this scenario and prevent app crashes.  The solution ensures smooth operation even when the state is still initializing, leading to a more resilient application.
